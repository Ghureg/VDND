# MagicShop
This is a proejct to generate and make a Spell Shop for during character creation. This can also generate a random spell. 

Currently this is easily run. Simply double click on 'run.bat' It will start the tkinter window. It should be pretty self explanitory after that. Upon submitting what you would want, it will open the file for you with what ever you requested inside. I could have it open up in a text window and stay alive, but Ive opted for this method for the way i ahndle documents while running character creation. It also makes it easier to send to the other person.

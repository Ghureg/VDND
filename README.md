# VDND
This is a repository that exsists for simple tools that I have designed to help create and facitlitate diffrent sessions of DND. These are using homebrewed materials and assets. This has nothing to do with the offical game.

## Magic_Shop
Magic Shop is a python program designed to create magic shops for character creation. It also can pull random spells.
